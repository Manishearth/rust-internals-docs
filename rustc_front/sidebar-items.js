Each overridden visit method has full control over what happens with its node, it can do its own traversal of the node's children, call `intravisit::walk_*` to apply the default traversal algorithm, or prevent deeper traversal by doing nothing.When visiting the HIR, the contents of nested items are NOT visited by default. This is different from the AST visitor, which does a deep walk. Hence this module is called `intravisit`; see the method `visit_nested_item` for more details.Note: it is an important invariant that the default visitor walks the body of a function in \"execution order\" (more concretely, reverse post-order with respect to the CFG implied by the AST), meaning that if AST node A may execute before AST node B, then A is visited first.  The borrow checker in particular relies on this property."],["lowering",""],["print",""],["util",""]]});
