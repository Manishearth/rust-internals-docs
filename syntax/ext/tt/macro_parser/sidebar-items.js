Each leaf in a single NamedMatch corresponds to a single token::MATCH_NONTERMINAL in the TokenTree that produced it.The in-memory structure of a particular NamedMatch represents the match that occurred when a particular subset of a matcher was applied to a particular token tree.The width of each MatchedSeq in the NamedMatch, and the identity of the `MatchedNonterminal`s, will depend on the token tree it was applied to: each MatchedSeq corresponds to a single TTSeq in the originating token tree. The depth of the NamedMatch structure will therefore depend only on the nesting depth of `ast::TTSeq`s in the originating token tree it was derived from."],["ParseResult",""]],"fn":[["count_names",""],["initial_matcher_pos",""],["nameize",""],["parse",""],["parse_nt",""],["token_name_eq","Perform a token equality check, ignoring syntax context (that is, an unhygienic comparison)"]],"struct":[["MatcherPos",""]],"type":[["NamedParseResult",""],["PositionalParseResult",""]]});
