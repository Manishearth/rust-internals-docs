Mesa pretty-printer, as described in appendix A of</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">STAN-CS-79-770: &quot;Pretty Printing&quot;, by Derek C. Oppen.
Stanford Department of Computer Science, 1979.
</code></pre>

<p>The algorithm&#39;s aim is to break a stream into as few lines as possible
while respecting the indentation-consistency requirements of the enclosing
block, and avoiding breaking at silly places on block boundaries, for
example, between &quot;x&quot; and &quot;)&quot; in &quot;x)&quot;.</p>

<p>I am implementing this algorithm because it comes with 20 pages of
documentation explaining its theory, and because it addresses the set of
concerns I&#39;ve seen other pretty-printers fall down on. Weirdly. Even though
it&#39;s 32 years old. What can I say?</p>

<p>Despite some redundancies and quirks in the way it&#39;s implemented in that
paper, I&#39;ve opted to keep the implementation here as similar as I can,
changing only what was blatantly wrong, a typo, or sufficiently
non-idiomatic rust that it really stuck out.</p>

<p>In particular you&#39;ll see a certain amount of churn related to INTEGER vs.
CARDINAL in the Mesa implementation. Mesa apparently interconverts the two
somewhat readily? In any case, I&#39;ve used usize for indices-in-buffers and
ints for character-sizes-and-indentation-offsets. This respects the need
for ints to &quot;go negative&quot; while carrying a pending-calculation balance, and
helps differentiate all the numbers flying around internally (slightly).</p>

<p>I also inverted the indentation arithmetic used in the print stack, since
the Mesa implementation (somewhat randomly) stores the offset on the print
stack in terms of margin-col rather than col itself. I store col.</p>

<p>I also implemented a small change in the String token, in that I store an
explicit length for the string. For most tokens this is just the length of
the accompanying string. But it&#39;s necessary to permit it to differ, for
encoding things that are supposed to &quot;go on their own line&quot; -- certain
classes of comment and blank-line -- where relying on adjacent
hardbreak-like Break tokens with long blankness indication doesn&#39;t actually
work. To see why, consider when there is a &quot;thing that should be on its own
line&quot; between two long blocks, say functions. If you put a hardbreak after
each function (or before each) and the breaking algorithm decides to break
there anyways (because the functions themselves are long) you wind up with
extra blank lines. If you don&#39;t put hardbreaks you can wind up with the
&quot;thing which should be on its own line&quot; not getting its own line in the
rare case of &quot;really small functions&quot; or such. This re-occurs with comments
and explicit blank lines. So in those cases we use a string with a payload
we want isolated to a line and an explicit length that&#39;s huge, surrounded
by two zero-length breaks. The algorithm will try its best to fit it on a
line (which it can&#39;t) and so naturally place the content on its own line to
avoid combining it with other lines and making matters even worse.</p>

<h1 id='explanation' class='section-header'><a href='#explanation'>Explanation</a></h1>
<p>In case you do not have the paper, here is an explanation of what&#39;s going
on.</p>

<p>There is a stream of input tokens flowing through this printer.</p>

<p>The printer buffers up to 3N tokens inside itself, where N is linewidth.
Yes, linewidth is chars and tokens are multi-char, but in the worst
case every token worth buffering is 1 char long, so it&#39;s ok.</p>

<p>Tokens are String, Break, and Begin/End to delimit blocks.</p>

<p>Begin tokens can carry an offset, saying &quot;how far to indent when you break
inside here&quot;, as well as a flag indicating &quot;consistent&quot; or &quot;inconsistent&quot;
breaking. Consistent breaking means that after the first break, no attempt
will be made to flow subsequent breaks together onto lines. Inconsistent
is the opposite. Inconsistent breaking example would be, say:</p>

<pre class="rust rust-example-rendered">
<span class="ident">foo</span>(<span class="ident">hello</span>, <span class="ident">there</span>, <span class="ident">good</span>, <span class="ident">friends</span>)</pre>

<p>breaking inconsistently to become</p>

<pre class="rust rust-example-rendered">
<span class="ident">foo</span>(<span class="ident">hello</span>, <span class="ident">there</span>
    <span class="ident">good</span>, <span class="ident">friends</span>);</pre>

<p>whereas a consistent breaking would yield:</p>

<pre class="rust rust-example-rendered">
<span class="ident">foo</span>(<span class="ident">hello</span>,
    <span class="ident">there</span>
    <span class="ident">good</span>,
    <span class="ident">friends</span>);</pre>

<p>That is, in the consistent-break blocks we value vertical alignment
more than the ability to cram stuff onto a line. But in all cases if it
can make a block a one-liner, it&#39;ll do so.</p>

<p>Carrying on with high-level logic:</p>

<p>The buffered tokens go through a ring-buffer, &#39;tokens&#39;. The &#39;left&#39; and
&#39;right&#39; indices denote the active portion of the ring buffer as well as
describing hypothetical points-in-the-infinite-stream at most 3N tokens
apart (i.e. &quot;not wrapped to ring-buffer boundaries&quot;). The paper will switch
between using &#39;left&#39; and &#39;right&#39; terms to denote the wrapped-to-ring-buffer
and point-in-infinite-stream senses freely.</p>

<p>There is a parallel ring buffer, <code>size</code>, that holds the calculated size of
each token. Why calculated? Because for Begin/End pairs, the &quot;size&quot;
includes everything between the pair. That is, the &quot;size&quot; of Begin is
actually the sum of the sizes of everything between Begin and the paired
End that follows. Since that is arbitrarily far in the future, <code>size</code> is
being rewritten regularly while the printer runs; in fact most of the
machinery is here to work out <code>size</code> entries on the fly (and give up when
they&#39;re so obviously over-long that &quot;infinity&quot; is a good enough
approximation for purposes of line breaking).</p>

<p>The &quot;input side&quot; of the printer is managed as an abstract process called
SCAN, which uses <code>scan_stack</code>, to manage calculating <code>size</code>. SCAN is, in
other words, the process of calculating &#39;size&#39; entries.</p>

<p>The &quot;output side&quot; of the printer is managed by an abstract process called
PRINT, which uses <code>print_stack</code>, <code>margin</code> and <code>space</code> to figure out what to
do with each token/size pair it consumes as it goes. It&#39;s trying to consume
the entire buffered window, but can&#39;t output anything until the size is &gt;=
0 (sizes are set to negative while they&#39;re pending calculation).</p>

<p>So SCAN takes input and buffers tokens and pending calculations, while
PRINT gobbles up completed calculations and tokens from the buffer. The
theory is that the two can never get more than 3N tokens apart, because
once there&#39;s &quot;obviously&quot; too much data to fit on a line, in a size
calculation, SCAN will write &quot;infinity&quot; to the size and let PRINT consume
it.</p>

<p>In this implementation (following the paper, again) the SCAN process is
the method called <code>Printer::pretty_print</code>, and the &#39;PRINT&#39; process is the method
called <code>Printer::print</code>.</p>
