</details></div></div><div class='docblock'><p>Finds crate binaries and loads their metadata</p>

<p>Might I be the first to welcome you to a world of platform differences,
version requirements, dependency graphs, conflicting desires, and fun! This
is the major guts (along with metadata::creader) of the compiler for loading
crates and resolving dependencies. Let&#39;s take a tour!</p>

<h1 id='the-problem' class='section-header'><a href='#the-problem'>The problem</a></h1>
<p>Each invocation of the compiler is immediately concerned with one primary
problem, to connect a set of crates to resolved crates on the filesystem.
Concretely speaking, the compiler follows roughly these steps to get here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Discover a set of <code>extern crate</code> statements.</li>
<li>Transform these directives into crate names. If the directive does not
have an explicit name, then the identifier is the name.</li>
<li>For each of these crate names, find a corresponding crate on the
filesystem.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sounds easy, right? Let&#39;s walk into some of the nuances.</p>

<h2 id='transitive-dependencies' class='section-header'><a href='#transitive-dependencies'>Transitive Dependencies</a></h2>
<p>Let&#39;s say we&#39;ve got three crates: A, B, and C. A depends on B, and B depends
on C. When we&#39;re compiling A, we primarily need to find and locate B, but we
also end up needing to find and locate C as well.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that any of B&#39;s types could be composed of C&#39;s types,
any function in B could return a type from C, etc. To be able to guarantee
that we can always typecheck/translate any function, we have to have
complete knowledge of the whole ecosystem, not just our immediate
dependencies.</p>

<p>So now as part of the &quot;find a corresponding crate on the filesystem&quot; step
above, this involves also finding all crates for <em>all upstream
dependencies</em>. This includes all dependencies transitively.</p>

<h2 id='rlibs-and-dylibs' class='section-header'><a href='#rlibs-and-dylibs'>Rlibs and Dylibs</a></h2>
<p>The compiler has two forms of intermediate dependencies. These are dubbed
rlibs and dylibs for the static and dynamic variants, respectively. An rlib
is a rustc-defined file format (currently just an ar archive) while a dylib
is a platform-defined dynamic library. Each library has a metadata somewhere
inside of it.</p>

<p>A third kind of dependency is an rmeta file. These are metadata files and do
not contain any code, etc. To a first approximation, these are treated in the
same way as rlibs. Where there is both an rlib and an rmeta file, the rlib
gets priority (even if the rmeta file is newer). An rmeta file is only
useful for checking a downstream crate, attempting to link one will cause an
error.</p>

<p>When translating a crate name to a crate on the filesystem, we all of a
sudden need to take into account both rlibs and dylibs! Linkage later on may
use either one of these files, as each has their pros/cons. The job of crate
loading is to discover what&#39;s possible by finding all candidates.</p>

<p>Most parts of this loading systems keep the dylib/rlib as just separate
variables.</p>

<h2 id='where-to-look' class='section-header'><a href='#where-to-look'>Where to look?</a></h2>
<p>We can&#39;t exactly scan your whole hard drive when looking for dependencies,
so we need to places to look. Currently the compiler will implicitly add the
target lib search path ($prefix/lib/rustlib/$target/lib) to any compilation,
and otherwise all -L flags are added to the search paths.</p>

<h2 id='what-criterion-to-select-on' class='section-header'><a href='#what-criterion-to-select-on'>What criterion to select on?</a></h2>
<p>This a pretty tricky area of loading crates. Given a file, how do we know
whether it&#39;s the right crate? Currently, the rules look along these lines:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does the filename match an rlib/dylib pattern? That is to say, does the
filename have the right prefix/suffix?</li>
<li>Does the filename have the right prefix for the crate name being queried?
This is filtering for files like <code>libfoo*.rlib</code> and such.</li>
<li>Is the file an actual rust library? This is done by loading the metadata
from the library and making sure it&#39;s actually there.</li>
<li>Does the name in the metadata agree with the name of the library?</li>
<li>Does the target in the metadata agree with the current target?</li>
<li>Does the SVH match? (more on this later)</li>
</ol>

<p>If the file answers <code>yes</code> to all these questions, then the file is
considered as being <em>candidate</em> for being accepted. It is illegal to have
more than two candidates as the compiler has no method by which to resolve
this conflict. Additionally, rlib/dylib candidates are considered
separately.</p>

<p>After all this has happened, we have 1 or two files as candidates. These
represent the rlib/dylib file found for a library, and they&#39;re returned as
being found.</p>

<h3 id='what-about-versions' class='section-header'><a href='#what-about-versions'>What about versions?</a></h3>
<p>A lot of effort has been put forth to remove versioning from the compiler.
There have been forays in the past to have versioning baked in, but it was
largely always deemed insufficient to the point that it was recognized that
it&#39;s probably something the compiler shouldn&#39;t do anyway due to its
complicated nature and the state of the half-baked solutions.</p>

<p>With a departure from versioning, the primary criterion for loading crates
is just the name of a crate. If we stopped here, it would imply that you
could never link two crates of the same name from different sources
together, which is clearly a bad state to be in.</p>

<p>To resolve this problem, we come to the next section!</p>

<h1 id='expert-mode' class='section-header'><a href='#expert-mode'>Expert Mode</a></h1>
<p>A number of flags have been added to the compiler to solve the &quot;version
problem&quot; in the previous section, as well as generally enabling more
powerful usage of the crate loading system of the compiler. The goal of
these flags and options are to enable third-party tools to drive the
compiler with prior knowledge about how the world should look.</p>

<h2 id='the---extern-flag' class='section-header'><a href='#the---extern-flag'>The <code>--extern</code> flag</a></h2>
<p>The compiler accepts a flag of this form a number of times:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">--extern crate-name=path/to/the/crate.rlib
</code></pre>

<p>This flag is basically the following letter to the compiler:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear rustc,</p>

<p>When you are attempting to load the immediate dependency <code>crate-name</code>, I
would like you to assume that the library is located at
<code>path/to/the/crate.rlib</code>, and look nowhere else. Also, please do not
assume that the path I specified has the name <code>crate-name</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This flag basically overrides most matching logic except for validating that
the file is indeed a rust library. The same <code>crate-name</code> can be specified
twice to specify the rlib/dylib pair.</p>

<h2 id='enabling-multiple-versions' class='section-header'><a href='#enabling-multiple-versions'>Enabling &quot;multiple versions&quot;</a></h2>
<p>This basically boils down to the ability to specify arbitrary packages to
the compiler. For example, if crate A wanted to use Bv1 and Bv2, then it
would look something like:</p>

<div class='information'><div class='tooltip compile_fail'>âš <span class='tooltiptext'>This code doesn't compile so be extra careful!</span></div></div><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered compile_fail">
<span class="kw">extern</span> <span class="kw">crate</span> <span class="ident">b1</span>;
<span class="kw">extern</span> <span class="kw">crate</span> <span class="ident">b2</span>;

<span class="kw">fn</span> <span class="ident">main</span>() {}</pre>

<p>and the compiler would be invoked as:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">rustc a.rs --extern b1=path/to/libb1.rlib --extern b2=path/to/libb2.rlib
</code></pre>

<p>In this scenario there are two crates named <code>b</code> and the compiler must be
manually driven to be informed where each crate is.</p>

<h2 id='frobbing-symbols' class='section-header'><a href='#frobbing-symbols'>Frobbing symbols</a></h2>
<p>One of the immediate problems with linking the same library together twice
in the same problem is dealing with duplicate symbols. The primary way to
deal with this in rustc is to add hashes to the end of each symbol.</p>

<p>In order to force hashes to change between versions of a library, if
desired, the compiler exposes an option <code>-C metadata=foo</code>, which is used to
initially seed each symbol hash. The string <code>foo</code> is prepended to each
string-to-hash to ensure that symbols change over time.</p>

<h2 id='loading-transitive-dependencies' class='section-header'><a href='#loading-transitive-dependencies'>Loading transitive dependencies</a></h2>
<p>Dealing with same-named-but-distinct crates is not just a local problem, but
one that also needs to be dealt with for transitive dependencies. Note that
in the letter above <code>--extern</code> flags only apply to the <em>local</em> set of
dependencies, not the upstream transitive dependencies. Consider this
dependency graph:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">A.1   A.2
|     |
|     |
B     C
 \   /
  \ /
   D
</code></pre>

<p>In this scenario, when we compile <code>D</code>, we need to be able to distinctly
resolve <code>A.1</code> and <code>A.2</code>, but an <code>--extern</code> flag cannot apply to these
transitive dependencies.</p>

<p>Note that the key idea here is that <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> are both <em>already compiled</em>.
That is, they have already resolved their dependencies. Due to unrelated
technical reasons, when a library is compiled, it is only compatible with
the <em>exact same</em> version of the upstream libraries it was compiled against.
We use the &quot;Strict Version Hash&quot; to identify the exact copy of an upstream
library.</p>

<p>With this knowledge, we know that <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> will depend on <code>A</code> with
different SVH values, so we crawl the normal <code>-L</code> paths looking for
<code>liba*.rlib</code> and filter based on the contained SVH.</p>

<p>In the end, this ends up not needing <code>--extern</code> to specify upstream
transitive dependencies.</p>

<h1 id='wrapping-up' class='section-header'><a href='#wrapping-up'>Wrapping up</a></h1>
<p>That&#39;s the general overview of loading crates in the compiler, but it&#39;s by
no means all of the necessary details. Take a look at the rest of
metadata::locator or metadata::creader for all the juicy details!</p>
