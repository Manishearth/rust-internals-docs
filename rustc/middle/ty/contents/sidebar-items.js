You can think of them as kind of an \"anti-kind\".  They track the kinds of values and thinks that are contained in types.  Having a larger contents for a type tends to rule that type *out* from various kinds.  For example, a type that contains a reference is not sendable.The reason we compute type contents and not kinds is that it is easier for me (nmatsakis) to think about what is contained within a type than to think about what is *not* contained within a type."]]});
