A struct pattern's arity is the number of fields it contains, etc."],["specialize","This is the main specialization step. It expands the first pattern in the given row into `arity` patterns based on the constructor. For most patterns, the step is trivial, for instance tuple patterns are flattened and box patterns expand into their inner pattern.OTOH, slice patterns with a subslice pattern (..tail) can be expanded into multiple different patterns. Structure patterns with a partial wild pattern (Foo { a: 42, .. }) have their missing fields filled with wild patterns."]],"struct":[["MatchCheckCtxt",""],["StaticInliner",""]]});
