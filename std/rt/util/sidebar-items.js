Normally this is not a problem, but in some tests, we produce a lot of threads casually.  Making lots of threads alone might not be a problem _either_, except on OSX, the segments produced for new threads _take a while_ to get reclaimed by the OS. Combined with the fact that libuv schedulers fork off a separate thread for polling fsevents on OSX, we get a perfect storm of creating \"too many mappings\" for valgrind to handle when running certain stress tests in the runtime."],["min_stack",""],["report_overflow",""],["running_on_valgrind","Dynamically inquire about whether we're running under V.
