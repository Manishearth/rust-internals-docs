initSidebarItems({"struct":[["OsStr","Slices into OS strings (see `OsString`)."],["OsString","A type that can represent owned, mutable platform-native strings, but is cheaply interconvertable with Rust strings.The need for this type arises from the fact that:On Unix systems, strings are often arbitrary sequences of non-zero bytes, in many cases interpreted as UTF-8.On Windows, strings are often arbitrary sequences of non-zero 16-bit values, interpreted as UTF-16 when it is valid to do so.In Rust, strings are always valid UTF-8, but may contain zeros.`OsString` and `OsStr` bridge this gap by simultaneously representing Rust and platform-native string values, and in particular allowing a Rust string to be converted into an \"OS\" string with no cost."]]});
