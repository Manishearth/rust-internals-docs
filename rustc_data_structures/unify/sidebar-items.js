We implement Tarjan's union-find algorithm: when two keys are unified, one of them is converted into a \"redirect\" pointing at the other. These redirects form a DAG: the roots of the DAG (nodes that are not redirected) are each associated with a value of type `V` and a rank. The rank is used to keep the DAG relatively balanced, which helps keep the running time of the algorithm under control. For more information, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure."]],"trait":[["Combine","This trait is implemented for unify values that can be combined.
