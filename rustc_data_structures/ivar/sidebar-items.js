A full implementation is used for concurrency and blocks on a read of an unfulfilled value. This implementation is more minimal and panics if you attempt to read the value before it has been set. It is also not `Sync`, but may be extended in the future to be usable as a true concurrency type.The `T: Copy` bound is not strictly needed, but it is required by Cell (so removing it would require using UnsafeCell), and it suffices for the current purposes."]]});
