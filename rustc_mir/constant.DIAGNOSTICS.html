  &quot;\nThe value of statics and constants must be known at compile time, and they live\nfor the entire lifetime of a program. Creating a boxed value allocates memory on\nthe heap at runtime, and therefore cannot be done at compile time. Erroneous\ncode example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0010\n#![feature(box_syntax)]\n\nconst CON : Box&lt;i32&gt; = box 0;\n```\n&quot;),
 (&quot;E0013&quot;,
  &quot;\nStatic and const variables can refer to other const variables. But a const\nvariable cannot refer to a static variable. For example, `Y` cannot refer to\n`X` here:\n\n```compile_fail,E0013\nstatic X: i32 = 42;\nconst Y: i32 = X;\n```\n\nTo fix this, the value can be extracted as a const and then used:\n\n```\nconst A: i32 = 42;\nstatic X: i32 = A;\nconst Y: i32 = A;\n```\n&quot;),
 (&quot;E0015&quot;,
  &quot;\nThe only functions that can be called in static or constant expressions are\n`const` functions, and struct/enum constructors. `const` functions are only\navailable on a nightly compiler. Rust currently does not support more general\ncompile-time function execution.\n\n```\nconst FOO: Option&lt;u8&gt; = Some(1); // enum constructor\nstruct Bar {x: u8}\nconst BAR: Bar = Bar {x: 1}; // struct constructor\n```\n\nSee [RFC 911] for more details on the design of `const fn`s.\n\n[RFC 911]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0911-const-fn.md\n&quot;),
 (&quot;E0016&quot;,
  &quot;\nBlocks in constants may only contain items (such as constant, function\ndefinition, etc...) and a tail expression. Erroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0016\nconst FOO: i32 = { let x = 0; x }; // \&#39;x\&#39; isn\&#39;t an item!\n```\n\nTo avoid it, you have to replace the non-item object:\n\n```\nconst FOO: i32 = { const X : i32 = 0; X };\n```\n&quot;),
 (&quot;E0017&quot;,
  &quot;\nReferences in statics and constants may only refer to immutable values.\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0017\nstatic X: i32 = 1;\nconst C: i32 = 2;\n\n// these three are not allowed:\nconst CR: &amp;\&#39;static mut i32 = &amp;mut C;\nstatic STATIC_REF: &amp;\&#39;static mut i32 = &amp;mut X;\nstatic CONST_REF: &amp;\&#39;static mut i32 = &amp;mut C;\n```\n\nStatics are shared everywhere, and if they refer to mutable data one might\nviolate memory safety since holding multiple mutable references to shared data\nis not allowed.\n\nIf you really want global mutable state, try using `static mut` or a global\n`UnsafeCell`.\n&quot;),
 (&quot;E0018&quot;,
  &quot;\n\nThe value of static and constant integers must be known at compile time. You\ncan\&#39;t cast a pointer to an integer because the address of a pointer can\nvary.\n\nFor example, if you write:\n\n```compile_fail,E0018\nstatic MY_STATIC: u32 = 42;\nstatic MY_STATIC_ADDR: usize = &amp;MY_STATIC as *const _ as usize;\nstatic WHAT: usize = (MY_STATIC_ADDR^17) + MY_STATIC_ADDR;\n```\n\nThen `MY_STATIC_ADDR` would contain the address of `MY_STATIC`. However,\nthe address can change when the program is linked, as well as change\nbetween different executions due to ASLR, and many linkers would\nnot be able to calculate the value of `WHAT`.\n\nOn the other hand, static and constant pointers can point either to\na known numeric address or to the address of a symbol.\n\n```\nstatic MY_STATIC: u32 = 42;\nstatic MY_STATIC_ADDR: &amp;\&#39;static u32 = &amp;MY_STATIC;\nconst CONST_ADDR: *const u8 = 0x5f3759df as *const u8;\n```\n\nThis does not pose a problem by itself because they can\&#39;t be\naccessed directly.\n&quot;),
 (&quot;E0019&quot;,
  &quot;\nA function call isn\&#39;t allowed in the const\&#39;s initialization expression\nbecause the expression\&#39;s value must be known at compile-time. Erroneous code\nexample:\n\n```compile_fail\nenum Test {\n    V1\n}\n\nimpl Test {\n    fn test(&amp;self) -&gt; i32 {\n        12\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    const FOO: Test = Test::V1;\n\n    const A: i32 = FOO.test(); // You can\&#39;t call Test::func() here!\n}\n```\n\nRemember: you can\&#39;t use a function call inside a const\&#39;s initialization\nexpression! However, you can totally use it anywhere else:\n\n```\nenum Test {\n    V1\n}\n\nimpl Test {\n    fn func(&amp;self) -&gt; i32 {\n        12\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    const FOO: Test = Test::V1;\n\n    FOO.func(); // here is good\n    let x = FOO.func(); // or even here!\n}\n```\n&quot;),
 (&quot;E0022&quot;,
  &quot;\nConstant functions are not allowed to mutate anything. Thus, binding to an\nargument with a mutable pattern is not allowed. For example,\n\n```compile_fail\nconst fn foo(mut x: u8) {\n    // do stuff\n}\n```\n\nIs incorrect because the function body may not mutate `x`.\n\nRemove any mutable bindings from the argument list to fix this error. In case\nyou need to mutate the argument, try lazily initializing a global variable\ninstead of using a `const fn`, or refactoring the code to a functional style to\navoid mutation if possible.\n&quot;),
 (&quot;E0133&quot;,
  &quot;\nUnsafe code was used outside of an unsafe function or block.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0133\nunsafe fn f() { return; } // This is the unsafe code\n\nfn main() {\n    f(); // error: call to unsafe function requires unsafe function or block\n}\n```\n\nUsing unsafe functionality is potentially dangerous and disallowed by safety\nchecks. Examples:\n\n* Dereferencing raw pointers\n* Calling functions via FFI\n* Calling functions marked unsafe\n\nThese safety checks can be relaxed for a section of the code by wrapping the\nunsafe instructions with an `unsafe` block. For instance:\n\n```\nunsafe fn f() { return; }\n\nfn main() {\n    unsafe { f(); } // ok!\n}\n```\n\nSee also https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition/unsafe.html\n&quot;),
 (&quot;E0373&quot;,
  &quot;\nThis error occurs when an attempt is made to use data captured by a closure,\nwhen that data may no longer exist. It\&#39;s most commonly seen when attempting to\nreturn a closure:\n\n```compile_fail,E0373\nfn foo() -&gt; Box&lt;Fn(u32) -&gt; u32&gt; {\n    let x = 0u32;\n    Box::new(|y| x + y)\n}\n```\n\nNotice that `x` is stack-allocated by `foo()`. By default, Rust captures\nclosed-over data by reference. This means that once `foo()` returns, `x` no\nlonger exists. An attempt to access `x` within the closure would thus be\nunsafe.\n\nAnother situation where this might be encountered is when spawning threads:\n\n```compile_fail,E0373\nfn foo() {\n    let x = 0u32;\n    let y = 1u32;\n\n    let thr = std::thread::spawn(|| {\n        x + y\n    });\n}\n```\n\nSince our new thread runs in parallel, the stack frame containing `x` and `y`\nmay well have disappeared by the time we try to use them. Even if we call\n`thr.join()` within foo (which blocks until `thr` has completed, ensuring the\nstack frame won\&#39;t disappear), we will not succeed: the compiler cannot prove\nthat this behaviour is safe, and so won\&#39;t let us do it.\n\nThe solution to this problem is usually to switch to using a `move` closure.\nThis approach moves (or copies, where possible) data into the closure, rather\nthan taking references to it. For example:\n\n```\nfn foo() -&gt; Box&lt;Fn(u32) -&gt; u32&gt; {\n    let x = 0u32;\n    Box::new(move |y| x + y)\n}\n```\n\nNow that the closure has its own copy of the data, there\&#39;s no need to worry\nabout safety.\n&quot;),
 (&quot;E0381&quot;,
  &quot;\nIt is not allowed to use or capture an uninitialized variable. For example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0381\nfn main() {\n    let x: i32;\n    let y = x; // error, use of possibly uninitialized variable\n}\n```\n\nTo fix this, ensure that any declared variables are initialized before being\nused. Example:\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    let x: i32 = 0;\n    let y = x; // ok!\n}\n```\n&quot;),
 (&quot;E0382&quot;,
  &quot;\nThis error occurs when an attempt is made to use a variable after its contents\nhave been moved elsewhere. For example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0382\nstruct MyStruct { s: u32 }\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut x = MyStruct{ s: 5u32 };\n    let y = x;\n    x.s = 6;\n    println!(\&quot;{}\&quot;, x.s);\n}\n```\n\nSince `MyStruct` is a type that is not marked `Copy`, the data gets moved out\nof `x` when we set `y`. This is fundamental to Rust\&#39;s ownership system: outside\nof workarounds like `Rc`, a value cannot be owned by more than one variable.\n\nSometimes we don\&#39;t need to move the value. Using a reference, we can let another\nfunction borrow the value without changing its ownership. In the example below,\nwe don\&#39;t actually have to move our string to `calculate_length`, we can give it\na reference to it with `&amp;` instead.\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    let s1 = String::from(\&quot;hello\&quot;);\n\n    let len = calculate_length(&amp;s1);\n\n    println!(\&quot;The length of \&#39;{}\&#39; is {}.\&quot;, s1, len);\n}\n\nfn calculate_length(s: &amp;String) -&gt; usize {\n    s.len()\n}\n```\n\nA mutable reference can be created with `&amp;mut`.\n\nSometimes we don\&#39;t want a reference, but a duplicate. All types marked `Clone`\ncan be duplicated by calling `.clone()`. Subsequent changes to a clone do not\naffect the original variable.\n\nMost types in the standard library are marked `Clone`. The example below\ndemonstrates using `clone()` on a string. `s1` is first set to \&quot;many\&quot;, and then\ncopied to `s2`. Then the first character of `s1` is removed, without affecting\n`s2`. \&quot;any many\&quot; is printed to the console.\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    let mut s1 = String::from(\&quot;many\&quot;);\n    let s2 = s1.clone();\n    s1.remove(0);\n    println!(\&quot;{} {}\&quot;, s1, s2);\n}\n```\n\nIf we control the definition of a type, we can implement `Clone` on it ourselves\nwith `#[derive(Clone)]`.\n\nSome types have no ownership semantics at all and are trivial to duplicate. An\nexample is `i32` and the other number types. We don\&#39;t have to call `.clone()` to\nclone them, because they are marked `Copy` in addition to `Clone`.  Implicit\ncloning is more convienient in this case. We can mark our own types `Copy` if\nall their members also are marked `Copy`.\n\nIn the example below, we implement a `Point` type. Because it only stores two\nintegers, we opt-out of ownership semantics with `Copy`. Then we can\n`let p2 = p1` without `p1` being moved.\n\n```\n#[derive(Copy, Clone)]\nstruct Point { x: i32, y: i32 }\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut p1 = Point{ x: -1, y: 2 };\n    let p2 = p1;\n    p1.x = 1;\n    println!(\&quot;p1: {}, {}\&quot;, p1.x, p1.y);\n    println!(\&quot;p2: {}, {}\&quot;, p2.x, p2.y);\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, if we don\&#39;t control the struct\&#39;s definition, or mutable shared\nownership is truly required, we can use `Rc` and `RefCell`:\n\n```\nuse std::cell::RefCell;\nuse std::rc::Rc;\n\nstruct MyStruct { s: u32 }\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut x = Rc::new(RefCell::new(MyStruct{ s: 5u32 }));\n    let y = x.clone();\n    x.borrow_mut().s = 6;\n    println!(\&quot;{}\&quot;, x.borrow().s);\n}\n```\n\nWith this approach, x and y share ownership of the data via the `Rc` (reference\ncount type). `RefCell` essentially performs runtime borrow checking: ensuring\nthat at most one writer or multiple readers can access the data at any one time.\n\nIf you wish to learn more about ownership in Rust, start with the chapter in the\nBook:\n\nhttps://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition/ownership.html\n&quot;),
 (&quot;E0383&quot;,
  &quot;\nThis error occurs when an attempt is made to partially reinitialize a\nstructure that is currently uninitialized.\n\nFor example, this can happen when a drop has taken place:\n\n```compile_fail,E0383\nstruct Foo {\n    a: u32,\n}\nimpl Drop for Foo {\n    fn drop(&amp;mut self) { /* ... */ }\n}\n\nlet mut x = Foo { a: 1 };\ndrop(x); // `x` is now uninitialized\nx.a = 2; // error, partial reinitialization of uninitialized structure `t`\n```\n\nThis error can be fixed by fully reinitializing the structure in question:\n\n```\nstruct Foo {\n    a: u32,\n}\nimpl Drop for Foo {\n    fn drop(&amp;mut self) { /* ... */ }\n}\n\nlet mut x = Foo { a: 1 };\ndrop(x);\nx = Foo { a: 2 };\n```\n&quot;),
 (&quot;E0384&quot;,
  &quot;\nThis error occurs when an attempt is made to reassign an immutable variable.\nFor example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0384\nfn main() {\n    let x = 3;\n    x = 5; // error, reassignment of immutable variable\n}\n```\n\nBy default, variables in Rust are immutable. To fix this error, add the keyword\n`mut` after the keyword `let` when declaring the variable. For example:\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    let mut x = 3;\n    x = 5;\n}\n```\n&quot;),
 (&quot;E0387&quot;,
  &quot;\nThis error occurs when an attempt is made to mutate or mutably reference data\nthat a closure has captured immutably. Examples of this error are shown below:\n\n```compile_fail,E0387\n// Accepts a function or a closure that captures its environment immutably.\n// Closures passed to foo will not be able to mutate their closed-over state.\nfn foo&lt;F: Fn()&gt;(f: F) { }\n\n// Attempts to mutate closed-over data. Error message reads:\n// `cannot assign to data in a captured outer variable...`\nfn mutable() {\n    let mut x = 0u32;\n    foo(|| x = 2);\n}\n\n// Attempts to take a mutable reference to closed-over data.  Error message\n// reads: `cannot borrow data mutably in a captured outer variable...`\nfn mut_addr() {\n    let mut x = 0u32;\n    foo(|| { let y = &amp;mut x; });\n}\n```\n\nThe problem here is that foo is defined as accepting a parameter of type `Fn`.\nClosures passed into foo will thus be inferred to be of type `Fn`, meaning that\nthey capture their context immutably.\n\nIf the definition of `foo` is under your control, the simplest solution is to\ncapture the data mutably. This can be done by defining `foo` to take FnMut\nrather than Fn:\n\n```\nfn foo&lt;F: FnMut()&gt;(f: F) { }\n```\n\nAlternatively, we can consider using the `Cell` and `RefCell` types to achieve\ninterior mutability through a shared reference. Our example\&#39;s `mutable`\nfunction could be redefined as below:\n\n```\nuse std::cell::Cell;\n\nfn foo&lt;F: Fn()&gt;(f: F) { }\n\nfn mutable() {\n    let x = Cell::new(0u32);\n    foo(|| x.set(2));\n}\n```\n\nYou can read more about cell types in the API documentation:\n\nhttps://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/\n&quot;),
 (&quot;E0388&quot;, &quot;\nE0388 was removed and is no longer issued.\n&quot;),
 (&quot;E0389&quot;,
  &quot;\nAn attempt was made to mutate data using a non-mutable reference. This\ncommonly occurs when attempting to assign to a non-mutable reference of a\nmutable reference (`&amp;(&amp;mut T)`).\n\nExample of erroneous code:\n\n```compile_fail,E0389\nstruct FancyNum {\n    num: u8,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut fancy = FancyNum{ num: 5 };\n    let fancy_ref = &amp;(&amp;mut fancy);\n    fancy_ref.num = 6; // error: cannot assign to data in a `&amp;` reference\n    println!(\&quot;{}\&quot;, fancy_ref.num);\n}\n```\n\nHere, `&amp;mut fancy` is mutable, but `&amp;(&amp;mut fancy)` is not. Creating an\nimmutable reference to a value borrows it immutably. There can be multiple\nreferences of type `&amp;(&amp;mut T)` that point to the same value, so they must be\nimmutable to prevent multiple mutable references to the same value.\n\nTo fix this, either remove the outer reference:\n\n```\nstruct FancyNum {\n    num: u8,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut fancy = FancyNum{ num: 5 };\n\n    let fancy_ref = &amp;mut fancy;\n    // `fancy_ref` is now &amp;mut FancyNum, rather than &amp;(&amp;mut FancyNum)\n\n    fancy_ref.num = 6; // No error!\n\n    println!(\&quot;{}\&quot;, fancy_ref.num);\n}\n```\n\nOr make the outer reference mutable:\n\n```\nstruct FancyNum {\n    num: u8\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut fancy = FancyNum{ num: 5 };\n\n    let fancy_ref = &amp;mut (&amp;mut fancy);\n    // `fancy_ref` is now &amp;mut(&amp;mut FancyNum), rather than &amp;(&amp;mut FancyNum)\n\n    fancy_ref.num = 6; // No error!\n\n    println!(\&quot;{}\&quot;, fancy_ref.num);\n}\n```\n&quot;),
 (&quot;E0394&quot;,
  &quot;\nA static was referred to by value by another static.\n\nErroneous code examples:\n\n```compile_fail,E0394\nstatic A: u32 = 0;\nstatic B: u32 = A; // error: cannot refer to other statics by value, use the\n                   //        address-of operator or a constant instead\n```\n\nA static cannot be referred by value. To fix this issue, either use a\nconstant:\n\n```\nconst A: u32 = 0; // `A` is now a constant\nstatic B: u32 = A; // ok!\n```\n\nOr refer to `A` by reference:\n\n```\nstatic A: u32 = 0;\nstatic B: &amp;\&#39;static u32 = &amp;A; // ok!\n```\n&quot;),
 (&quot;E0395&quot;,
  &quot;\nThe value assigned to a constant scalar must be known at compile time,\nwhich is not the case when comparing raw pointers.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0395\nstatic FOO: i32 = 42;\nstatic BAR: i32 = 42;\n\nstatic BAZ: bool = { (&amp;FOO as *const i32) == (&amp;BAR as *const i32) };\n// error: raw pointers cannot be compared in statics!\n```\n\nThe address assigned by the linker to `FOO` and `BAR` may or may not\nbe identical, so the value of `BAZ` can\&#39;t be determined.\n\nIf you want to do the comparison, please do it at run-time.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nstatic FOO: i32 = 42;\nstatic BAR: i32 = 42;\n\nlet baz: bool = { (&amp;FOO as *const i32) == (&amp;BAR as *const i32) };\n// baz isn\&#39;t a constant expression so it\&#39;s ok\n```\n&quot;),
 (&quot;E0161&quot;,
  &quot;\nA value was moved. However, its size was not known at compile time, and only\nvalues of a known size can be moved.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail\n#![feature(box_syntax)]\n\nfn main() {\n    let array: &amp;[isize] = &amp;[1, 2, 3];\n    let _x: Box&lt;[isize]&gt; = box *array;\n    // error: cannot move a value of type [isize]: the size of [isize] cannot\n    //        be statically determined\n}\n```\n\nIn Rust, you can only move a value when its size is known at compile time.\n\nTo work around this restriction, consider \&quot;hiding\&quot; the value behind a reference:\neither `&amp;x` or `&amp;mut x`. Since a reference has a fixed size, this lets you move\nit around as usual. Example:\n\n```\n#![feature(box_syntax)]\n\nfn main() {\n    let array: &amp;[isize] = &amp;[1, 2, 3];\n    let _x: Box&lt;&amp;[isize]&gt; = box array; // ok!\n}\n```\n&quot;),
 (&quot;E0396&quot;,
  &quot;\nThe value behind a raw pointer can\&#39;t be determined at compile-time\n(or even link-time), which means it can\&#39;t be used in a constant\nexpression. Erroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0396\nconst REG_ADDR: *const u8 = 0x5f3759df as *const u8;\n\nconst VALUE: u8 = unsafe { *REG_ADDR };\n// error: raw pointers cannot be dereferenced in constants\n```\n\nA possible fix is to dereference your pointer at some point in run-time.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nconst REG_ADDR: *const u8 = 0x5f3759df as *const u8;\n\nlet reg_value = unsafe { *REG_ADDR };\n```\n&quot;),
 (&quot;E0492&quot;,
  &quot;\nA borrow of a constant containing interior mutability was attempted. Erroneous\ncode example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0492\nuse std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, ATOMIC_USIZE_INIT};\n\nconst A: AtomicUsize = ATOMIC_USIZE_INIT;\nstatic B: &amp;\&#39;static AtomicUsize = &amp;A;\n// error: cannot borrow a constant which may contain interior mutability,\n//        create a static instead\n```\n\nA `const` represents a constant value that should never change. If one takes\na `&amp;` reference to the constant, then one is taking a pointer to some memory\nlocation containing the value. Normally this is perfectly fine: most values\ncan\&#39;t be changed via a shared `&amp;` pointer, but interior mutability would allow\nit. That is, a constant value could be mutated. On the other hand, a `static` is\nexplicitly a single memory location, which can be mutated at will.\n\nSo, in order to solve this error, either use statics which are `Sync`:\n\n```\nuse std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, ATOMIC_USIZE_INIT};\n\nstatic A: AtomicUsize = ATOMIC_USIZE_INIT;\nstatic B: &amp;\&#39;static AtomicUsize = &amp;A; // ok!\n```\n\nYou can also have this error while using a cell type:\n\n```compile_fail,E0492\n#![feature(const_cell_new)]\n\nuse std::cell::Cell;\n\nconst A: Cell&lt;usize&gt; = Cell::new(1);\nconst B: &amp;\&#39;static Cell&lt;usize&gt; = &amp;A;\n// error: cannot borrow a constant which may contain interior mutability,\n//        create a static instead\n\n// or:\nstruct C { a: Cell&lt;usize&gt; }\n\nconst D: C = C { a: Cell::new(1) };\nconst E: &amp;\&#39;static Cell&lt;usize&gt; = &amp;D.a; // error\n\n// or:\nconst F: &amp;\&#39;static C = &amp;D; // error\n```\n\nThis is because cell types do operations that are not thread-safe. Due to this,\nthey don\&#39;t implement Sync and thus can\&#39;t be placed in statics. In this\ncase, `StaticMutex` would work just fine, but it isn\&#39;t stable yet:\nhttps://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/sync/struct.StaticMutex.html\n\nHowever, if you still wish to use these types, you can achieve this by an unsafe\nwrapper:\n\n```\n#![feature(const_cell_new)]\n\nuse std::cell::Cell;\nuse std::marker::Sync;\n\nstruct NotThreadSafe&lt;T&gt; {\n    value: Cell&lt;T&gt;,\n}\n\nunsafe impl&lt;T&gt; Sync for NotThreadSafe&lt;T&gt; {}\n\nstatic A: NotThreadSafe&lt;usize&gt; = NotThreadSafe { value : Cell::new(1) };\nstatic B: &amp;\&#39;static NotThreadSafe&lt;usize&gt; = &amp;A; // ok!\n```\n\nRemember this solution is unsafe! You will have to ensure that accesses to the\ncell are synchronized.\n&quot;),

  &quot;\nA reference of an interior static was assigned to another const/static.\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0494\nstruct Foo {\n    a: u32\n}\n\nstatic S : Foo = Foo { a : 0 };\nstatic A : &amp;\&#39;static u32 = &amp;S.a;\n// error: cannot refer to the interior of another static, use a\n//        constant instead\n```\n\nThe \&quot;base\&quot; variable has to be a const if you want another static/const variable\nto refer to one of its fields. Example:\n\n```\nstruct Foo {\n    a: u32\n}\n\nconst S : Foo = Foo { a : 0 };\nstatic A : &amp;\&#39;static u32 = &amp;S.a; // ok!\n```\n&quot;),

Take a look at\nhttps://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/references-and-borrowing.html for more\ninformation. Example:\n\n\n```\nlet mut i = 0;\nlet mut x = &amp;mut i; // ok!\n\n// or:\nlet mut i = 0;\nlet a = &amp;i; // ok!\nlet b = &amp;i; // still ok!\nlet c = &amp;i; // still ok!\n```\n&quot;),

To fix this issue,\nyou can put the closure in its own scope:\n\n```\nfn you_know_nothing(jon_snow: &amp;mut i32) {\n    {\n        let nights_watch = || {\n            *jon_snow = 2;\n        };\n    } // At this point, `jon_snow` is free.\n    let starks = || {\n        *jon_snow = 3;\n    };\n}\n```\n\nOr, if the type implements the `Clone` trait, you can clone it between\nclosures:\n\n```\nfn you_know_nothing(jon_snow: &amp;mut i32) {\n    let mut jon_copy = jon_snow.clone();\n    let nights_watch = || {\n        jon_copy = 2;\n    };\n    let starks = || {\n        *jon_snow = 3;\n    };\n}\n```\n&quot;),

However, a struct cannot be dropped if one or\nmore of its fields have been moved.\n\nStructs implementing the `Drop` trait have an implicit destructor that gets\ncalled when they go out of scope.

Therefore, we must think of all values whose type implements the\n`Drop` trait as single units whose fields cannot be moved.\n\nThis error can be fixed by creating a reference to the fields of a struct,\nenum, or tuple using the `ref` keyword:\n\n```\nstruct FancyNum {\n    num: usize\n}\n\nstruct DropStruct {\n    fancy: FancyNum\n}\n\nimpl Drop for DropStruct {\n    fn drop(&amp;mut self) {\n        // Destruct DropStruct, possibly using FancyNum\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let drop_struct = DropStruct{fancy: FancyNum{num: 5}};\n    let ref fancy_field = drop_struct.fancy; // No more errors!\n    println!(\&quot;Fancy: {}\&quot;, fancy_field.num);\n    // implicit call to `drop_struct.drop()` as drop_struct goes out of scope\n}\n```\n\nNote that this technique can also be used in the arms of a match expression:\n\n```\nstruct FancyNum {\n    num: usize\n}\n\nenum DropEnum {\n    Fancy(FancyNum)\n}\n\nimpl Drop for DropEnum {\n    fn drop(&amp;mut self) {\n        // Destruct DropEnum, possibly using FancyNum\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // Creates and enum of type `DropEnum`, which implements `Drop`\n    let drop_enum = DropEnum::Fancy(FancyNum{num: 10});\n    match drop_enum {\n        // Creates a reference to the inside of `DropEnum::Fancy`\n        DropEnum::Fancy(ref fancy_field) =&gt; // No error!\n            println!(\&quot;It was fancy-- {}!\&quot;, fancy_field.num),\n    }\n    // implicit call to `drop_enum.drop()` as drop_enum goes out of scope\n}\n```\n&quot;),

  &quot;\nThis error occurs because you tried to mutably borrow a non-mutable variable.\n\nExample of erroneous code:\n\n```compile_fail,E0596\nlet x = 1;\nlet y = &amp;mut x; // error: cannot borrow mutably\n```\n\nIn here, `x` isn\&#39;t mutable, so when we try to mutably borrow it in `y`, it\nfails. To fix this error, you need to make `x` mutable:\n\n```\nlet mut x = 1;\nlet y = &amp;mut x; // ok!\n```\n&quot;),
 (&quot;E0597&quot;,
  &quot;\nThis error occurs because a borrow was made inside a variable which has a\ngreater lifetime than the borrowed one.\n\nExample of erroneous code:\n\n```compile_fail,E0597\nstruct Foo&lt;\&#39;a&gt; {\n    x: Option&lt;&amp;\&#39;a u32&gt;,\n}\n\nlet mut x = Foo { x: None };\nlet y = 0;\nx.x = Some(&amp;y); // error: `y` does not live long enough\n```\n\nIn here, `x` is created before `y` and therefore has a greater lifetime. Always\nkeep in mind that values in a scope are dropped in the opposite order they are\ncreated. So to fix the previous example, just make the `y` lifetime greater than\nthe `x`\&#39;s one:\n\n```\nstruct Foo&lt;\&#39;a&gt; {\n    x: Option&lt;&amp;\&#39;a u32&gt;,\n}\n\nlet y = 0;\nlet mut x = Foo { x: None };\nx.x = Some(&amp;y);\n```\n&quot;),
 (&quot;E0626&quot;,
  &quot;\nThis error occurs because a borrow in a generator persists across a\nyield point.\n\n```compile_fail,E0626\n# #![feature(generators, generator_trait)]\n# use std::ops::Generator;\nlet mut b = || {\n    let a = &amp;String::new(); // &lt;-- This borrow...\n    yield (); // ...is still in scope here, when the yield occurs.\n    println!(\&quot;{}\&quot;, a);\n};\nb.resume();\n```\n\nAt present, it is not permitted to have a yield that occurs while a\nborrow is still in scope. To resolve this error, the borrow must\neither be \&quot;contained\&quot; to a smaller scope that does not overlap the\nyield or else eliminated in another way. So, for example, we might\nresolve the previous example by removing the borrow and just storing\nthe integer by value:\n\n```\n# #![feature(generators, generator_trait)]\n# use std::ops::Generator;\nlet mut b = || {\n    let a = 3;\n    yield ();\n    println!(\&quot;{}\&quot;, a);\n};\nb.resume();\n```\n\nThis is a very simple case, of course. In more complex cases, we may\nwish to have more than one reference to the value that was borrowed --\nin those cases, something like the `Rc` or `Arc` types may be useful.\n\nThis error also frequently arises with iteration:\n\n```compile_fail,E0626\n# #![feature(generators, generator_trait)]\n# use std::ops::Generator;\nlet mut b = || {\n  let v = vec![1,2,3];\n  for &amp;x in &amp;v { // &lt;-- borrow of `v` is still in scope...\n    yield x; // ...when this yield occurs.\n  }\n};\nb.resume();\n```\n\nSuch cases can sometimes be resolved by iterating \&quot;by value\&quot; (or using\n`into_iter()`) to avoid borrowing:\n\n```\n# #![feature(generators, generator_trait)]\n# use std::ops::Generator;\nlet mut b = || {\n  let v = vec![1,2,3];\n  for x in v { // &lt;-- Take ownership of the values instead!\n    yield x; // &lt;-- Now yield is OK.\n  }\n};\nb.resume();\n```\n\nIf taking ownership is not an option, using indices can work too:\n\n```\n# #![feature(generators, generator_trait)]\n# use std::ops::Generator;\nlet mut b = || {\n  let v = vec![1,2,3];\n  let len = v.len(); // (*)\n  for i in 0..len {\n    let x = v[i]; // (*)\n    yield x; // &lt;-- Now yield is OK.\n  }\n};\nb.resume();\n\n// (*) -- Unfortunately, these temporaries are currently required.\n// See &lt;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43122&gt;.\n```\n&quot;)]</code></pre><div class='stability'><div class='stab unstable'><details><summary><span class=microscope>🔬</span> This is a nightly-only experimental API.
