initSidebarItems({"struct":[["Exp","The exponential distribution `Exp(lambda)`.This distribution has density function: `f(x) = lambda * exp(-lambda * x)` for `x > 0`."],["Exp1","A wrapper around an `f64` to generate Exp(1) random numbers.See `Exp` for the general exponential distribution. Note that this has to be unwrapped before use as an `f64` (using either `*` or `mem::transmute` is safe).Implemented via the ZIGNOR variant[1] of the Ziggurat method. The exact description in the paper was adjusted to use tables for the exponential distribution rather than normal.[1]: Jurgen A.
